### Robnhood Case Study: A look at their meteroic rise

Robinhood was established to take online trading, and among other financial services, mobile. It would use a sleek, mobile platform that would be easy to navigate by the tech savvy millenial and Gen Z populations. They are in the process of taking on legacy financial institutions like Charles Schwab and E-Trade. 

Their mobile platform and no fee trading structure make them more attractive to younger generations interested in financial markets. 

They are exemplary as the first company to really do this at scale. They offer a unique product and capitalize on services that their competitors many see as ancillary. Going forward they look to continue to capitalize on their advantages and as long as they successfully navigate the regulatory environment and there are no major drawdowns in the broader financial markets.
